# Dynastio.Net

Dynastio.Net is an unofficial, modern, highâ€‘performance .NET API client for interacting with Dynast.io game services, enabling access to player stats, servers, leaderboards, and more for bots, dashboards, and companion apps.



## Why this library

Built to make Dynast.io data easy to consume, Dynastio.Net powers practical use cases like Discord bots, overlays, and gameplay analytics. Itâ€™s the API library behind the Dynastio.Bot project and was created with that integration in mind.

- **Discord bots:** Streamline commands that surface player stats and server info.  
- **Dashboards/overlays:** Display live server and leaderboard data.  
- **Automation:** Track trends, alerts, and match histories.  
- **Companion tools:** Enrich community apps with authenticated player data.

> Unofficial wrapper structured around public behavior of the Dynast.io API.

---

## Installation

Install via NuGet using your preferred workflow:

- **Package Manager:**
  ```
  Install-Package Dynastio.Net
  ```
- **.NET CLI:**
  ```
  dotnet add package Dynastio.Net
  ```
These commands are published with the package on NuGet and the repository readme.

Supported target frameworks include .NET 5.0 and .NET Framework 4.6 and higher, per the NuGet listing.

---

## Quick start

Below is a minimal example to list online servers and inspect top server stats. The structure mirrors the samples and published usage shown in the package documentation and historical listings.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

using Dynastio.Net; // Namespace may vary depending on the package assembly

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        // Replace with your Dynast.io API token
        var client = new DynastioClient("YOUR_API_TOKEN");

        // Get online servers (async)
        var onlineServers = await client.Game.GetOnlineServersAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"Servers: {onlineServers.Count} online.");

        // Peek at one server's highlights
        var server = onlineServers.FirstOrDefault();
        if (server != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Server: {server.Label}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Top player: {server.TopPlayerName} ({server.TopPlayerScore})");
            Console.WriteLine($"Lifetime: {server.Lifetime}");
        }

        // Example: fetch a player's personal chest by external ID (e.g., Discord)
        var chest = await client.Database.GetUserPersonalChestAsync("discord:YOUR_DISCORD_ID");
        foreach (var item in chest.Items)
            Console.WriteLine($"{item.ItemType}: {item.Count}");
    }
}
```

> See repository samples for additional patterns and context on async usage.

## Features

Dynastio.Net focuses on an ergonomic, async-first developer experience with practical endpoints for community tools. Highlights include:

- **Live data:** Fetch online servers and current player info.
- **Leaderboards:** Pull rank snapshots and surrounding ranks.
- **Player profiles:** Retrieve profiles and personal chests.
- **Announcements/media:** Read featured videos and news.
- **Performance:** Built-in caching to reduce API load.
- **Async by default:** Optimized with System.Text.Json.
- **Extensible:** Clear structure for customization and extension.

---

## API overview

The client surface generally maps to domain areas like Game and Database, exposing common operations shown in public examples and package docs.

- **Game:**
  - **Online servers:** Enumerate servers and inspect properties like top player and lifetime.
  - **Version/changelog:** Query current version metadata.
- **Players:**
  - **Live players per server:** Inspect active player list with nickname and score.
  - **Profiles and stats:** Retrieve profile details and ranks.
- **Database:**
  - **Personal chest:** Fetch authenticated inventory-style data linked to user IDs.

> Endpoint coverage and names evolve with the Dynast.io service; check samples and source for current shapes.

## Used by Dynastio.Bot

Dynastio.Net is used in the open-source Dynastio.Bot, a .NET Core Discord bot that integrates deeply with Dynast.io. The library was effectively made to support that botâ€™s needs, and serves as its API backbone.

---

## Roadmap

Planned enhancements include real-time updates (e.g., websockets where applicable), stronger error handling, localization improvements, and richer SDK documentation and IntelliSense, as outlined in the repository.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome:
1. **Fork:** Create your copy of the repository.
2. **Branch:** git checkout -b feature/YourFeature
3. **Commit:** Write clear, atomic commits.
4. **PR:** Open a pull request describing changes and context.

Open issues for ideas, bugs, or questions.
